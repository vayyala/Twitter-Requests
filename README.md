# Twitter-Requests

This is an example to learn to make Requests to Twitter's API. The TwitterRequest function supports any call to Twitters API. To make different calls, change the endpoint argument. The program also uses pickle in order to store data during large requests of data and sleep during rate limited periods. IMPORTANT: Do not abuse Twitter's API by making very large requests that may take days to run. 


Instructions:

1) Create your app on Twitter's Developer Website. Copy your consumer and acess keys and secrets to the keys.py file.


2) install any packages that you do not have installed. I will add a requirements.txt soon


3) Write a function that uses TwitterRequest() with a specific endpoint. I have written get_friends() as an example of how to do this
